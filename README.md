# Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a basic image classification task using TensorFlow. The goal is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Setup and Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Code Explanation

### Task 1: Introduction
- Import TensorFlow library and set verbosity.
- Check the TensorFlow version.

### Task 2: The Dataset
- Import the MNIST dataset.
- Display the shapes of the imported arrays.
- Plot an example image from the dataset.

### Task 3: One Hot Encoding
- Encode the labels using one-hot encoding.

### Task 5: Preprocessing the Examples
- Reshape the input images.
- Normalize the pixel values.

### Task 6: Creating a Model
- Define and compile the neural network model.

### Task 7: Training the Model
- Train the model using the training data.

### Task 8: Evaluating the Model
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

### Task 9: Predictions
- Generate predictions on the test set.
- Visualize the predictions using Matplotlib.

## Results

- Trained the model with an accuracy of 96% on the test set.
- Visualized predictions on a subset of the test set using Matplotlib.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the main script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
